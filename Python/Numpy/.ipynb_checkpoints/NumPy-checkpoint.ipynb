    "NumPy is a Python package built around the concept of ndarrays (n-dimensional arrays) along with a suite of efficient functions for applying operations over those arrays. Many of the other important packages for data scientists are built on top of NumPy (e.g. Pandas, scikit-learn). In the previous tutorial we dicussed arrays and why they may be more useful than lists in many cases (although, remember lists are useful because they are dynamically typed and can store multiple data-types in a single container). We also discussed how numpy arrays are represented in memory. In this session we will take a deeper dive into Numpy and start to explore some of the more advanced functionality."

    "\n",
    "This is a good moment to stop and consider indexing in a little more detail. In both lists and arrays each element has a value and also some header information associated with it. Being dynamically-typed the elements in a list have more of this \"metadata\" including the d-type; however much of this is removed from elements in arrays because they are statically-typed. In either case, along with the data value, each element has an index. This is the position inside the data container where the value can be found, for example the first element in a vector has index 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this indexing scheme is abstracted from how the information is stored in memory (strings of binary bits). To report the correct value the computer needs to know how many bits each value occupies in memory, where they start and finish and the spacing between them. This informaton is stored in the array's <i><b>\"stride\"</i></b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to traverse a vector to the 8-bit integer in index [1], the computer will stride over the 8 bits representing index[0] and retrieve the 8 bits that follow - the data associated with index[1]. Similarly, to obtain the 8-bit integer associated with index [5] it will traverse the array 8 * 5 bits and retrieve the following 8 bits because it knows stride = 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, a n-dimensional array is stored as a continuous string of bits and is abstracted up to a shaped array by the NumPy architecture. To do so, the number of bits in each element of each dimension is required. For example, in a small 2 x 2 array of 8-bit integers, there are 16 bits per row. To access the second row, NumPy must traverse the array 16 bits then begin reading the bits that follow. Similarly, accessing rows requires NumPy to read 8 bits separated by an entire row length. This principle holds true for arrays of any dimension.\n",

This makes sense because each 2D array is made up of 3 rows and 4 columns, which gives the array a size of 12 integers. Each integer is 8 bits long, so 12 * 8 = 96. Each time NumPy moves upwards or downwards in the 3rd dimenion it has to move back or forward the length of one entire 2D array - 96 bits.\n",

I will generally try to avoid using functions from packages such as NumPy and SciPy because they tend to abstract away the critical details that are reqired to understand the mechanics of the calculations we aim to understand. This is the first notebook in a short series and its scope includes simple mathematical operations on vectors and matrices and solving systems of equations using Gaussian and Gauss-Jordan elimination. Related concepts such as null space, row/column space, determinants, eigenvectors etc etc will be included in future notebooks.\n"

    "### The concept\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product is a flavour of multiplication that takes into account the similarities between two vectors. It is often described as \"directional multiplication\" or \"the push that one vector gives another\" or \"applying one vector to another\". It can be thought of as a measure of similarity because it operates on shared dimensions and ignores interactions between different dimensions, i.e. the sum of (x * x, y * y, z * z). It returns a scalar - i.e. a single digit, a point, a dot! \n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product returns a scalar from two vectors, or a vector from a matrix and a vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. The rectangular interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product multiplies the x component and the y component of two vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"dot_diagram.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. The rotational interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product can be thought of as multiplying two vectors after one has been projected onto the other (i.e. it has been rotated so that both vectors line up).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My favourite is the Mario Karts analogy explained here: https://betterexplained.com/articles/vector-calculus-understanding-the-dot-product/. In this game there are speed boosters on the track that give a greater acceleration to karts travelling parallel to the booster, wth diminishing acceleration as the kart's direction of travel becomes more perpendicular to the booster. The boost (a scalar multiplier of the kart's pre-boost velocity) is calculated as the dot product of the velocity of the kart and the velocity of the booster. This means if the kart is travelling at 0 m/s the boost is 0 (scalar * 0 = 0) and if the kart is travelling perpendicular to the booster the boost is 0 (because the component of the karts velocity vector that aligns with the booster is 0, so scalar * 0 = 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to calculate the dot product. The first uses the law of cosines, the second is the sum of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$a⋅b = ∥a∥ ∥b∥ cosθ$\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. length of vector a * length of vector b * cosine of angle between vectors a and b.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is most closely associated with the rotational explanation of the dot product, since it explicitly takes into account the angle between the two vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative is simply to calculate the sum of element-wise products between the two vectors. i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\Sigma (a_1b_1 , a_2b_2, ... a_n b_n) $\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dot Product in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by building custom functions so we understand how the dot product is calculated. We will start with a simpe function for the sum of products method for the dot product. We will then write a short function for calculating the angle between the two vectors using a simple rearrangement of the cosine dot product equation. We will then use that angle to calculate the dot product using the law of cosines method. Finally, we will quickly check that our answers from the two methods agree with one another."

    "Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers that we manipulate in often unexpected ways. So far we have seen the unexpected procedure for matrix multiplication, and in the following notebooks we will see many more somewhat surprising operations we apply to matrices. But why do these operations work and why are they useful? One answer to this question arises from the idea that matrices are stores of coefficients that define linear equations. This is what makes matrices a fundamental part of linear algebra. A linear equation is one that only includes addition of variables, each of which might be multiplied by a scalar. No terms are raised to any powers, no variables are multiplied together or combined in any other way than addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will explore the relationship between linear equations and matrices. We will see why this relationship is mathematically powerful and develop conceptual understanding of the rationale justifying operations such as matrix multiplication.\n",

    "In linear algebra, functions take vectors as inputs and return vectors as outputs. Earlier in this notebook we have seen that we can add and scalar-multiply vectors. A function can be thought of as a machine that transforms the input vector into an output vector. In calculus notation, we might refer to this machine as function $f$, e.g. $f(x) = 10x$. Here, we will refer to arbitrary linear functions using $L$. \n",

    "We can define two vectors, $u$ and $v$. Both $u$ and $v$ are valid inputs to $L$, such that $L(u)$ returns a new vector output $u'$ and $L(u)$ also returns a new vector output $v'$.\n",

    "\n",
    "$L(u+v) = L(u) + L(v)$\n",

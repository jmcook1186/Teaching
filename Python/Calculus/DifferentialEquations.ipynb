    "# Ordinary Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous notebooks introduced differentiation and integration. Here we look at differential equations, which are expressions that relate some function to its derivative. In this notebook we focus on ordinary differential equations (ODE's) which are those relating functions of one single variable ($f(x)$) to its derivative ($f'(x)$ or ${dy\\over{dx}}$), where $x$ is our independent variable and $y$ is our independent variable and is equivalent to the value of $f(x)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A general structure for a differential equation could be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "${dy\\over{dx}} = y(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is telling us that the derivative of some function $y$ is equal to the value of function $f$ evaluated at $x$. The challenge is then to solve this equation. This means reconstructing the equation $y$ whose derivative is given by the relation given in the ODE. <b>The solution to an ODE is a function</b>.\n",

    "## Solution via antiderivative\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest differential equations are essentially just derivative statements from which the original function can be reconstructed by finding the antiderivative. In our integral calculus notebook we saw how the antiderivative (or \"indefinite integral\") transforms a derivative into its corresponding function - i.e. it does the inverse of differentiation which produces the derivative from a function. Since our differential equation simpy relates a function to its derivative, antidifferentiation can sometimes provide a route to the equation's solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "${dy\\over{dx}} = sin(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation we are being told that the derivative of function $f$ at $x$ is equal to the sine of $x$. If the derivative is $sin(x)$ then the function must be the antiderivative of $sin(x)$ which is equal to $-cos(x)$. We can use SymPy to first verify that $-cos(x)$ is indeed the antiderivative of $sin(x)$, and then to verify that this antiderivative is the solution to the differential equation. We will take the antiderivative first, then solve the equation as the latter requires some fairly idiosyncratic syntax in SymPy."

    "### The concept\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product is a flavour of multiplication that takes into account the similarities between two vectors. It is often described as \"directional multiplication\" or \"the push that one vector gives another\" or \"applying one vector to another\". It can be thought of as a measure of similarity because it operates on shared dimensions and ignores interactions between different dimensions, i.e. the sum of (x * x, y * y, z * z). It returns a scalar - i.e. a single digit, a point, a dot! \n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product returns a scalar from two vectors, or a vector from a matrix and a vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. The rectangular interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product multiplies the x component and the y component of two vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. The rotational interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product can be thought of as multiplying two vectors after one has been projected onto the other (i.e. it has been rotated so that both vectors line up).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My favourite is the Mario Karts analogy explained here: https://betterexplained.com/articles/vector-calculus-understanding-the-dot-product/. In this game there are speed boosters on the track that give a greater acceleration to karts travelling parallel to the booster, wth diminishing acceleration as the kart's direction of travel becomes more perpendicular to the booster. The boost (a scalar multiplier of the kart's pre-boost velocity) is calculated as the dot product of the velocity of the kart and the velocity of the booster. This means if the kart is travelling at 0 m/s the boost is 0 (scalar * 0 = 0) and if the kart is travelling perpendicular to the booster the boost is 0 (because the component of the karts velocity vector that aligns with the booster is 0, so scalar * 0 = 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to calculate the dot product. The first uses the law of cosines, the second is the sum of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$a⋅b = ∥a∥ ∥b∥ cosθ$\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. length of vector a * length of vector b * cosine of angle between vectors a and b.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is most closely associated with the rotational explanation of the dot product, since it explicitly takes into account the angle between the two vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative is simply to calculate the sum of element-wise products between the two vectors. i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\Sigma (a_1b_1 , a_2b_2, ... a_n b_n) $\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dot Product in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by building custom functions so we understand how the dot product is calculated. We will start with a simpe function for the sum of products method for the dot product. We will then write a short function for calculating the angle between the two vectors using a simple rearrangement of the cosine dot product equation. We will then use that angle to calculate the dot product using the law of cosines method. Finally, we will quickly check that our answers from the two methods agree with one another."
